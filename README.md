"You just throw it in and BAM! It works!"

BAM! (Binary Analysis Metadata!) provides the user the ability to collect and analyze information on Windows Updates, 
updated files (i.e., PE files), and symbol files. 

Goal:
    Develop a tool that can (either on a schedule or manually) scan Windows updates, store
    information about those updates, obtain symbols for updated files, and review said information

Requirements:
* must have the least amount of dependiciaes (portability)
* must be able to run anywhere where python 3.6+ is installed
* must be efficient (threads over process and/or I/O or memory bound) 
* must be compartible to new python versions
* Back by sqlite for quick lookup of patches/PDBs and ability to 
* Microsoft's symsrv.dll and symsrv.yes MUST be placed in \Windows\System32\ by an administrator due to symchk.exe's functionality. 
* must enable the "Enable Win32 long paths" group policy under "Administrative Templates\System\FileSystem" beginning with Windows 10 v1607 (Anniversary Update)
* Must add location of Microsoft Debugging tools to PATH evnrionment variable


Microsoft's Symbol Connection and Download EULA:
symchk.exe will prompt the user to accept an Microsoft EULA when a symbol is going to be download from Microsoft's server. The symsrv.yes file (i.e., the YES file) is part of the Windows SDK installation in \Debugger\<arch>\ and is used to silently accept the Microsoft EULA to download the symbols from their servers. You can remove this file to individually accept/denied the EULA. 

Group Policy Requirement: Enable the "Enable Win32 long paths" GP under "Administrative Templates\System\FileSystem".
Due to the nature of how Windows updates are structured and named, they are given very long names when decompressed. BAM! will not run unless this group policy is enabled. Additionally, to avoid other long name errors during extraction and until the issue is resolved in the program, extract Update contents to a single character named directory.

Suggested Hardware requiments:
* 32GB of RAM
* 10TB of Disk space (extracted contents and downloaded symbols)
* 5TB of Disk space for WSUS to download all updates only (i.e., not OS/feature/service pack upgrades)
* 10 Virtual Processors

Needed disk space depends on what is downloaded and extracted. This will differ on your needs.

Use cases:

Display help:
py.exe main.py

Create or use current DB, extract files at <path to updates>, download symbols from Microsoft's symbol server (initially or continous use) and store them at <path to where syms are to be stored>: 
py.exe main.py -x -p "<path to updates>" -pd "<path to extract files too>" -sp "<path to where syms are to be stored>"
Side note: The script will always attempt to re-download symbols for PE files previously not downloaded.

Create or use current DB, extract files and download symbols from a specific symbol server (initially or continous use): 
py.exe main.py -x -p "<path to updates>" -pd "<path to extract files too>" -ss "<symstore location>" -sp "<path to where syms are to be stored>"
Side note: The script will always attempt to re-download symbols for PE files previously not downloaded.

Create or use current DB, extract files and verify symbols using local symstore (initially or continous use): 
py.exe main.py -x -p "<path to updates>" -pd "<path to extract files too>" -sl -ss "<directory path to symstore location or symbol location>" -sp "<path to where syms are to be stored>"

Create or update current DB (requires update file, extracted files, downloaded symbols):
py.exe main.py -c -p "<path to updates>" -pd "<path to extract files too>" -sl -ss "<directory path to symstore location or symbol location>" -sp "<path to where syms are to be stored>"

List total number of PE files within identified updates:

Verify total number of PE files within identified updates match extracted PE files
